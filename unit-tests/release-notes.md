## Release 2.30.0

Release Date: 4 Nov 2019

### API Changes

[link](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/wiki/API-Changes#version-2300)

### New Features & Improvements

* [\#4975](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/pull/4975) - New Cross-platform user-space implementation for supported USB protocols named `rsusb`. The refactored classes replace the multiplicity of UVC device per-platform implementations \(Windows, Unix, Android\) with a single cross-platform code infrastructure. In order to support the UVC device requirements, some modification were introduced into `rsusb` API, mainly adding asynchronous API to the USB messenger. Core Features:
  * Asynchronous API added to `rsusb` \(USB request\).
  * Multiple implementations of libuvc \(Win7 / Linux / Android\) replaced with single implementation
  * HID device modified to work with the new asynchronous API.

    Impact:

  * A new CMake option named `FORCE_RSUSB_BACKEND` added replaces the `FORCE_LIBUVC` and `FORCE_WINUSB_UVC` flags are now marked as deprecated. 
  * An update to WinUSB driver was implemented. **Important** - The new driver must be installed in order to use librealsense 2.30.0 or newer SDK version on Windows 7. Installation of the new driver is performed via [librealsense Windows 7 installer](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/releases/download/v2.30.0/Intel.RealSense.SDK-WIN7-2.30.0.1174.exe).

## Release 2.8.1

1 Nov 2017

> [API changes](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/wiki/API-Changes#from-280-to-281) from previous release

### New Features and Improvements

* [Depth Quality Tools](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/development/tools/depth-quality) now includes Z-Accuracy metric based on ground-truth \(DSO-6434\)
* librealsense CI now includes recorded test cases for the 4 major supported lines of devices - SR300, D415, D435 and other engineering models \(DSO-7101\)
* New example added showcasing the [Sensor API](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/master/examples/sensor-control) \(DSO-7016\)
* Set of new examples added showcasing working with [C API](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/master/examples/C) \(DSO-6909\)
* Added Python example for working with [D400 Advanced Mode](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/master/wrappers/python/python-rs400-advanced-mode-example.py) \(DSO-7287\)
* Added depth colorization options to the Viewer \(and the API\) \(DSO-7150\)

### Bug Fixes

* **\[Firmware\]** When Advance Mode is changed, the camera requires sometimes to disconnect/reconnect \(DSO-7015\)
* Pipeline fails to choose the correct device when several devices are connected \(DSO-7366\)
* When requesting 2 streams \(such as color and depth\) only one frameset is returned in the pipeline, instead of the 2 synchronized streams. \(DSO-7202\)

### Known Issues

* **\[Viewer\]** OpenGL tools and samples don't work with some types of Docking Stations\(ThinkPad USB3.0 Pro\) \(DSO-6674\)
* Windows - device disconnect events are sometimes not reported \(DSO-6813\)
* Windows - Soft stability issue: start-stop test hangs when RGB and Depth running together after hundreds of cycles \(DSO-6930\)
* Changing the gain value while Auto Exposure \(AE\) is enabled disables AE, this requires manually enabling AE \(DSO-6853\)
* GUI - The Output Viewer window doesn't show the bottom notifications \(DSO-7197\)
* Linux - When using IR format that is different than UYVY, the FPS drops to half \(DSO-7183\)

### Limitations

* **\[Firmware\]** Sometimes when RGB and Stereo resolutions are at FHD-HD, the RGB camera streaming stops and doesn't return even after turning the Depth Stereo to Off \(DSO-6894\)
