# Frame-Buffering-Management-in-RealSense-SDK-2.0

This document describes the functionality and limitations of frame buffering management. The SDK API provides a platform for defining how to manage the frames traffic that are sent by the librealsense library while streaming.

There are two main methods for frame buffering management:

* **Asynchronous method** - The librealsense library will pass each frame that is ready to be handled to a user pre-defined callback.
* **Synchronous method** - This method \(described below\), instead of handling the frames immediately in a callback, the received frames are queued in a frame queue and can be polled by the application.

## Latency vs. Performance

The RealSense™ ASIC does not have an internal full-frame buffer, so most latency in the system will come from system level buffering done in drivers or software. When setting the frame queue capacity the trade-off between latency and performance \(FPS\) must be taken into consideration.

Latency is always an important consideration for live-capture systems. To minimize latency in the SDK when streaming is configured, it is best to set the queue size \(the “capacity” parameter\) to 1 if enabling depth-only, and 2 if enabling both depth and color streams.

## Frame Buffering examples in the SDK

### frame\_queue

Frame queues are the simplest x-platform synchronization primitive provided by SDK to help developers who are not using asynchronous APIs.

```text
#define CAPACITY = 10
// Open sensor for exclusive access, by committing to a configuration
sensor.open(stream_profile);

//Creating frame queue and setting the queue capacity
rs2::frame_queue fq(CAPACITY);

//In order to begin getting data from the sensor, we need to register a class to handle frames, 
// in our case we provide the frame_queue when starting the sensor.
sensor.start(fq);

// “wait for frame” command, it is a blocking call.
// It will send data as soon as it becomes available, and will block until then.
rs2::frame f = fq.wait_for_frame();
// Do something with the received frame

// To stop streaming, we simply need to call the sensor's stop method
// After returning from the call to stop(), no frames will arrive from this sensor
sensor.stop();

// To complete the stop operation, and release access of the device, we need to call close() per sensor
sensor.close();
```

### syncer

For each frame the syncer searches for a matching frames and unites them to a composite frame, the resulted coherent frame sets are saved in a queue until the user calls the blocking call “wait for frames”. The user may use the syncer as a synchronized platform, it implements the API that allows it to be passed to the sensor as a class to handle the upcoming frames.

```text
#define CAPACITY = 10
// Open color and depth sensors for exclusive access, by committing to a configuration
depth_sensor.open(depth_stream);
color_sensor.open(color_stream);

// Create new syncer and set it’s capacity, by default the capacity is 1
rs2::syncer sync(CAPACITY);

//In order to begin getting data from the sensor, we need to register a class to handle frames, 
//in our case we provide the syncer at the sensor initialization.
depth_sensor.start(sync);
color_sensor.start(sync);

// Wait until receive a coherent set of frames
rs2::frameset fset = sync.wait_for_frames();
rs2::frame depth = fset.first_or_default(RS2_STREAM_DEPTH);
rs2::frame color = fset.first_or_default(RS2_STREAM_COLOR);
//do something with the frames

// To stop streaming, we simply need to call the sensor's stop method
// After returning from the call to stop(), no frames will arrive from this sensor
depth_sensor.stop();
color_sensor.stop();

// To complete the stop operation, and release access of the device, we need to call close()
//per sensor
depth_sensor.close();
color_sensor.close();
```

### pipeline

The pipeline simplifies the user interaction with the device and computer vision processing modules. The class abstracts the camera configuration and streaming, and the vision modules triggering and threading. It lets the application focus on the computer vision output of the modules, or the device output data. The pipeline can manage computer vision modules, which are implemented as a processing blocks. The pipeline is the consumer of the processing block interface, while the application consumes the computer vision interface. The pipeline is a synchronized platform, it contains a frame queue that buffers the received frames.

```text
// Declare RealSense pipeline, encapsulating the actual device and sensors
rs2::pipeline pipe;
// Start streaming with default recommended configuration
pipe.start();
// Wait for next set of frames from the camera
rs2::frameset data = pipe.wait_for_frames();
// Find the depth data
rs2::frame depth = color_map(data.get_depth_frame());
// Find the color data
rs2::frame color = data.get_color_frame();
```

The pipeline does not expose an API for setting the frame queue capacity, if the user wish to set the capacity to a value that is more compatible for his needs it can be done by changing the source code:

```text
//pipleline.cpp
#define CAPACITY
//The received frames are saved in the _queue, when pipeline’s “wait for frames” call
//is called internally it tries to dequeue a //frame from the single_consumer_queue queue.
//In the example we set the capacity to 10, by default the value is set to 1
pipeline_processing_block::pipeline_processing_block(
        const std::vector<int>& streams_to_aggregate) : 
            _queue(new single_consumer_queue<frame_holder>( CAPACITY)),
            _streams_ids(streams_to_aggregate)
{
...
}
```
