## Camera not working\detected

### Q: How do I see which Intel RealSense cameras are connected?

**Linux:**

```bash
$ lsusb | grep 8086
```

**Windows:**

1. Click the `Win-Key`+`X` keys
2. Choose `Device Manager`
3. Look under `Imaging devices` for "Intel RealSense" cameras

### Q: I connected the camera to the USB port but it is not recognized

> ❗️ Make sure your camera is connected using USB 3.0 ❗️

If your camera is connected via USB 3.0, check to make sure your OS detects the camera \([how?](troubleshooting-q-and-a.md#q-how-do-i-see-which-intel-realsense-cameras-are-connected)\). The camera will not work without USB 3.0 \(or higher\)

### Q: I'm using a virtual machine and the camera is not working

Due to the USB 3.0 translation layer between native hardware and virtual machine, the librealsense team does not support installation in a VM. If you do choose to try it, we recommend using VMware Workstation Player, and not Oracle VirtualBox for proper emulation of the USB3 controller.

### Q: Camera gets stuck\hangs on windows

Related issues: [Issue \#303](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/issues/303), [Issue \#129](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/issues/129)

When working on Windows 8.1, make sure you have [KB3075872](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3075872) and [KB2919355](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2919355) installed.

These patches address issues with Windows 8.1 video drivers. They should be resolved in Windows 10.

## Installation

### Q: `Fatal error: libudev.h:` when building from sources

From version 2.9.0 a new dependency third-party package `libudev-dev` has to be installed: `sudo apt-get install libudev-dev` See [Release Notes](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/wiki/Release-Notes#prerequisites) for v2.9.0

**Linux:**

### Q: How do I enable librealsense logs?

To change the log level of LibRealSense logger, you need to set a local variable named **LRS\_LOG\_LEVEL** and initialize it with the desirable log level:

**Linux:**

```bash
$ export LRS_LOG_LEVEL="<Log Level>"
```

**Windows:**

```bash
> set LRS_LOG_LEVEL="<Log Level>"
```

> `<Log Level>` can be either `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR` or `FATAL`

### Q: GCC Internal Error

The gcc compiler issues the following error while compiling:

> gcc: internal compiler error

This might indicate that you do not have enough memory or swap space on your machine. Try closing memory consuming applications, and if you are running inside a VM increase available RAM to at least 2 GB.

### Q: I ran the udev rules script but Linux still get `Permission denied`

First, try re-installing udev rules located in librealsense source directory: sudo cp config/99-realsense-libusb.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/ sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && udevadm trigger

If the issue persists, the cause might be due to the fact that your user is not part of the `plugdev` group.

### Q: `dmesg` shows: `uvcvideo: module verification failed: signature and/or required key missing - tainting kernel`

This is a standard warning issued since Kernel 4.4-30+, it is only a notification and does not affect module's functionality.

### Q: `sudo modprobe uvcvideo` produces `dmesg: uvc kernel module is not loaded`

This issue is caused since the patched module kernel version is incompatible with the resident kernel. Verify the actual kernel version with `uname -r`. Revert and proceed from [Make Ubuntu Up-to-date](../blob/master/doc/installation.md#make-ubuntu-up-to-date) step from the Linux installation guide.

### Q: `ubuntu-xenial.sh` script  fails with fatal error: `openssl/opensslv.h`

This is usually caused due to a missing dependency. Install _openssl_ package from [Video4Linux backend preparation](../blob/master/doc/installation.md#video4linux-backend-preparation) step

## Git

### Q: Git returns `access timeout` when I try to clone the repository

```text
git.launchpad... access timeout
```

This usually happens when your computer is behind a firewall, try to configure git to use the appropriate proxy server

## Python

### Q: CMake shows an error when I try to build with Python bindings

The following message appears:

> Could NOT find PythonInterp \(missing: PYTHON\_EXECUTABLE\)

Please check the following:

* Make sure Python is installed
* **On Windows**: If you've just installed python, reboot \(or log off\) and try again
  * Try the answers suggested here: [building-opencv-libraries-from-source-files](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9119253/building-opencv-libraries-from-source-files)

> Python config failure: Python is 32-bit, chosen compiler is 64-bit

If this message appears you should install python 64 bit
